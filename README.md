# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

# `npm start`

### `\adAdlliance`
To run the server on port 4000, you need e.g. XAMPP app (for MySQL connection)

### `cd  mini-ad-server`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## `sql db`
you must create a db with the name "ad_alliance" and then copy the code from the sql/ad_alliance.sql file into the sql console of your Data base server e.g MariaDB.

## `Note`
I would greatly appreciate it if you could help me to improve this little project!
